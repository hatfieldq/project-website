        <h2>Goal Of The Site</h2>
        <p>Even as a physics and computer science major in college,
            I never felt that I actually learned anything about front-end development.
            Most of my knowledge is in writing math functions and for loops. Which is 
            fine for my current modeling job, but I want to know more. To be fair, 
            I may not have applied myself in my computer science classes as much as 
            I could have. This is my attempt to turn that around. I will be working on 
            different projects related to web app development and electronic warfare (EW).
